# Google-Search-Hotkey
Automation using Python : Search Google using simple keyboard shortcut.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and specify a shortcut key for running the following command,
```shell 
 python3 /path/to/search.py
```
`/path/to/the/directory/` is the directory location, that needs to be uncluttered.

## Prerequisites
`python3` must be installed in your system.
<br />

And following Python modules are required and must be installed,
* pyperclip - used for accessing the clipboard
  ```shell 
  pip3 install pyperclip 
  ```

* selenium
  ```shell 
  pip3 install selenium 
  ```
  Selenium also requires web drivers to get control over web browsers. <br/>WebDrivers can be downloaded from the below-mentioned links,
   > Chrome:	https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads <br />
   > Edge:	https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/ <br />
   > Firefox:	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases <br />
   > Safari:	https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/ <br />
    
   Set environment paths for respective drivers. <br />
   E.g.: if chromedriver is not in your path, youâ€™ll need to add it here
     ```python 
     driver = webdriver.Chrome(r'C:\Python\chromedriver.exe')
     ```
## Usage

Copy `Ctrl+C` the text you want to search for and press the specified hotkeys to directly search on Google. <br> <br>
This tool searches for the last copied text on internet using Google and is a major time saver.
